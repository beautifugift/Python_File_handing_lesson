# Python_File_handling_lesson

Python file handling refers to the process of working with files, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting them. Python provides several built-in functions to handle these operations effectively.

*The main file handling operations include:*

Opening a File: Files can be opened using the open() function. It takes two parameters: the file name and the mode in which the file needs to be opened. Common modes include:

- 'r': Read (default mode). Opens the file for reading; an error occurs if the file does not exist.

- 'w': Write. Opens the file for writing; creates a new file if it doesn't exist or truncates the file if it exists.

- 'a': Append. Opens the file for appending; creates the file if it doesn't exist.

- 'b': Binary mode, which can be used with other modes (e.g., 'rb', 'wb').
